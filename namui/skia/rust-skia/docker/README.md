## Dockerfiles for building rust-skia

The Dockerfiles in this directory tree are _not_ official and might be out of date.

Please open an issue if one of them is not building anymore.

To help out, suggest how we can verify the Dockerfiles without building them with every commit on the CI (i.e. scheduled workflows once a week?), and submit a PR with the appropriate GitHub workflows.
