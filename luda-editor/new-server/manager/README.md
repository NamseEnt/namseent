## System Functionality:

- **Automatic Server Launch:** If the server is not running, it starts a new instance.
- **Provides Server Port:** Informs the user about the server port.
- **Checks for Code Updates:** Verifies if the code has been updated in the remote repository and relaunches the server. The existing server undergoes graceful shutdown, ensuring zero-downtime.
