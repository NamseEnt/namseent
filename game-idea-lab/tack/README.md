This prototype was built to validate the core fun of a mechanic I love from my favorite games like ZZZ, CS:GO, and Apex Legendsâ€”the excitement that comes from reacting to an abrupt signal. I identified this experience as being very similar to the Korean traditional game "Bori Bori Ssal," which became the foundation for this prototype.
The game is built around two key actions: the Basic Attack and the Parry.
The "Basic Attack" allows the player to engage offensively instead of just waiting idly for a signal. The "Parry" is a reactive move; when a signal appears, the player must press a specific key with precise timing. A successful parry, when immediately followed by a Basic Attack, unleashes a powerful "Parry Combo."
Despite being a simple text-based prototype, I found the experience surprisingly immersive.
Moving forward, I plan to implement this core mechanic into a full-fledged game.
